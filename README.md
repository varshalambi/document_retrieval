# MistralDocs: Advanced Document Retrieval & Summarization

## Overview
MistralDocs is a high-performance document retrieval and summarization system built on the Mistral 7B foundation model. The system demonstrates a 15% accuracy improvement over baseline models through specialized fine-tuning and optimization techniques.

## Core Features
- **Intelligent Summarization**: Extract key insights from lengthy documents with state-of-the-art accuracy
- **Contextual Retrieval**: Semantic search capabilities that understand query intent
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuous model improvement through feedback loops

## Technical Architecture

### Model Foundation
- Base model: Mistral 7B
- Quantization: 4-bit precision (NF4 format) with double quantization for efficient inference
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
  - Rank: 8
  - Alpha: 32
  - Dropout: 0.1
  - Target modules: Query and Value projections

### Data Processing Pipeline
- LangChain integration for optimized data preprocessing
- Chunking strategy: 512 token chunks with 30 token overlap
- Document conversion from multiple formats (TXT, MD, PDF)
- Embeddings: BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 for semantic representation

### Training Methodology
- **Supervised Fine-Tuning**: Custom dataset derived from human-generated summaries
- **Reinforcement Learning**: RLHF approach using proximal policy optimization
  - Reward model trained on comparative feedback
  - Policy alignment with controlled learning rate (1e-5)

### Evaluation Metrics
Performance measured across multiple dimensions:
- ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L for summarization quality
- Precision, Recall, and F1 scores to balance completeness and conciseness

## Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/document_retrieval.git
cd document_retrieval
pip install -e .
```

### Quick Start
```python
from mistraldocs import DocumentRetriever

# Initialize the system
retriever = DocumentRetriever(
    model_path="./models/mistral-7b-finetuned",
    embedding_model="BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5",
    load_in_4bit=True
)

# Retrieve and summarize from a custom database
results = retriever.process_query(
    query="Key findings in the quarterly report",
    max_docs=10,
    temperature=0.2,
    max_new_tokens=400
)

print(results.summary)
```

### Custom Dataset Integration
```python
# Import your own documents
retriever.import_documents(
    directory_path="./my_documents/",
    chunk_size=512,
    chunk_overlap=30
)
```
